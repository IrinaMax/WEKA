## the lin ger was perform with slug.arff dataset, use linear regression to predict the weight from the length, 
and determine the correlation coefficient using 10-fold cross-validation is 0.91.

=== Run information ===

Scheme:       weka.classifiers.functions.LinearRegression -S 0 -R 1.0E-8 -num-decimal-places 4

      0.1109 * length +
     -2.4937

Time taken to build model: 0.1 seconds

=== Cross-validation ===
=== Summary ===

##  it seems from the graph of weight versus length that a logarithmic transform of one or both attributes may help the performance of linear regression. This can be done using Wekaâ€™s AddExpression filter.
 Preprocess panel >  Filter > AddExpression > in properties >expression > log(a1)     # for first attribute 
 Preprocess panel >  Filter > AddExpression > in properties >expression > log(a2)     #for second attribute
 and give them names logL and logW. Then fit Linear reg again, here is output
